# Features

tapcn takes a different approach to React Native UI. Instead of adding another dependency to manage, it gives you the source code directly. Here is why that matters.

## Not a Component Library

tapcn is **not** a traditional component library. There is no `npm install tapcn` that gives you a black-box package you cannot change. Instead, components are copied directly into your project using the CLI.

This means:

- **No version lock-in.** You are not stuck waiting for a library update to fix a bug or add a feature. The code is yours.
- **No dependency management nightmares.** Components do not pull in transitive dependencies you cannot control. What you see is what you get.
- **Full customization.** Every component is a file in your `components/ui/` directory. Change anything -- styles, behavior, structure -- without fighting abstractions.
- **No breaking changes.** Once a component is in your project, upstream changes never break your app.

Think of tapcn as a starting point, not a finished product. Pick the components you need, make them your own, and ship.

## Cross-Platform

Every tapcn component works on **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web** out of the box. There is no platform-specific code to maintain.

This is powered by [NativeWind v4](https://www.nativewind.dev/), which compiles Tailwind CSS classes to native styles at build time. You write familiar utility classes like `bg-primary` and `rounded-lg`, and NativeWind handles the rest -- whether that is a native `View` on mobile or a `div` on the web.

```tsx
// This works identically on iOS, Android, and Web
<Button variant="outline" size="lg">
  <Text>Cross-platform button</Text>
</Button>
```

## Accessible

Accessibility is not an afterthought. tapcn components are built on top of [@rn-primitives](https://rn-primitives.vercel.app/), which provides proper accessibility support across all platforms.

What you get:

- **Screen reader support.** Components announce themselves correctly with proper roles and labels.
- **Keyboard navigation.** Dialogs, menus, selects, and other interactive components are fully keyboard navigable.
- **WAI-ARIA patterns.** Where applicable, components follow established accessibility patterns -- focus management, escape-to-close, arrow key navigation, and more.
- **Platform-native behavior.** Accessibility adapts to each platform's conventions rather than forcing a single approach.

## AI Friendly

tapcn components are designed to be easy for AI tools to understand and work with. Each component is a **single file** of clean, readable TypeScript with consistent patterns.

Tools like **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot** can:

- Read and understand component structure immediately
- Modify styling, variants, and behavior confidently
- Generate new components following the same patterns
- Refactor and extend components without confusion

Because the code lives in your project (not hidden inside `node_modules`), AI tools have full context and can make changes directly.

```tsx
// Clean, readable pattern that AI tools understand
const buttonVariants = cva('flex-row items-center justify-center rounded-md', {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      default: 'bg-primary',
      outline: 'border border-input bg-background',
    },
    size: {
      default: 'h-10 px-4',
      sm: 'h-9 px-3',
      lg: 'h-11 px-8',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    variant: 'default',
    size: 'default',
  },
});
```

## Type-Safe Variants

tapcn uses [class-variance-authority](https://cva.style) (cva) for managing component variants. This gives you full TypeScript support for every variant and size a component offers.

- **Autocomplete.** Your editor suggests available variants as you type.
- **Type checking.** Pass an invalid variant and TypeScript catches it at build time.
- **Default variants.** Components have sensible defaults so you can use them without any props.
- **Composable.** Combine variant classes with additional Tailwind utilities using the `cn()` helper.

```tsx
// TypeScript knows exactly which variants are valid
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">
  <Text>Small outlined button</Text>
</Button>

// Type error: "ghost" is not assignable if not defined
<Badge variant="ghost">
  <Text>This would fail type checking</Text>
</Badge>
```

## shadcn/ui Compatible

tapcn uses the **same registry format** as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). This means:

- The `shadcn` CLI works directly with tapcn component URLs.
- If you have used shadcn/ui in a web project, the workflow is identical.
- The `components.json` configuration file follows the same schema.
- Component structure and naming conventions are consistent.

```npm
# The shadcn CLI works with tapcn registry URLs
npx shadcn@latest add https://tapcn.vercel.app/r/button.json
```

The tapcn CLI (`@tapcn/cli`) wraps this functionality and adds dependency resolution, so you do not have to manage registry URLs manually.

## Built on Proven Tech
