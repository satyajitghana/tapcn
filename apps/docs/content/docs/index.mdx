description: Introduction to tapcn - copy-paste UI components for React Native and Expo.
---

# Getting Started

**tapcn** is a collection of copy-paste UI components for React Native (Expo) that follows the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) philosophy. Components are not installed as npm packages -- they are copied directly into your project so you have full ownership and control.

## What is tapcn?

This is **not** a component library in the traditional sense. It is a set of beautifully designed, accessible components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Pick the components you need, customize them, and build your own component library.

### Key Features

- **Cross-platform**: Every component works on iOS, Android, and Web via NativeWind
- **Copy & paste**: Components live in your project. Full control, no version lock-in
- **Type-safe variants**: Built with `class-variance-authority` for type-safe styling
- **Accessible**: Uses `@rn-primitives` for proper accessibility on all platforms
- **AI friendly**: Simple, readable, self-documenting code that AI tools understand
- **shadcn compatible**: Uses the same registry format, so `shadcn add` works with tapcn URLs

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize your project

```bash
npx @tapcn/cli init
```

This sets up NativeWind, global.css, tailwind.config, and creates a `components.json` file.

### 2. Add components

```bash
npx @tapcn/cli add button card input
```

Or use shadcn directly with our registry URL:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://tapcn.vercel.app/r/button.json
```

### 3. Use them

```tsx
import { Button } from '~/components/ui/button';
import { Text } from '~/components/ui/text';

export function MyScreen() {
  return (
    <Button variant="outline" onPress={() => console.log('pressed')}>
      <Text>Press me</Text>
    </Button>
  );
}
```
